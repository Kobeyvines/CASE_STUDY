-F1-Score: 0.54

### Features Used (Top 10 by Importance):
1.avg_monthly_transactions (Primary Driver)
2.days_since_last_transaction
3.avg_transaction_value
4.wallet_balance
5.tx_coverage (New: Balance vs. Avg Spend)
6.activity_intensity (New: Monthly tx vs. Tenure)
7.behavioral_deviation (New: Gap vs. Usual Habits)
8.county_Nairobi
9.county_Uasin Gishu
10.county_Kisumu

### Training Details:
    -Training Samples: 4,000 customers (80/20 Stratified Split)
    -Class Handling: scale_pos_weight: 2.66 (Corrects for 73/27 class imbalance)
    -Validation Approach: 3-Fold Cross-Validation (Grid Search)
