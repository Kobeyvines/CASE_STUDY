# Candidate FAQ - Phoenix KE Analytics Mentorship Case Studies

## General Questions

### Q: How much time should I spend on this?
**A:** Most candidates spend 8-15 hours total. Quality matters more than time spent. If you find yourself going over 20 hours, you might be overthinking it.

### Q: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude?
**A:** Yes, but you must be able to explain your entire analysis. We may ask you to walk through your work. Copy-paste solutions are obvious and will be disqualified.

### Q: What tools should I use?
**A:** Whatever you're comfortable with! Excel, Google Sheets, Python, R, Tableau - all are fine. We're evaluating your thinking, not your tool choice. Use what lets you do your best work.

### Q: Can I reach out with questions about the data or case?
**A:** Document any assumptions you make. Part of being a good analyst is working with ambiguity. However, if you find a genuine data quality issue (errors, corruption), please reach out.

### Q: Is there one "right" answer?
**A:** No! There are multiple valid approaches and insights. We're looking for clear thinking and good judgment, not a specific solution.

## Data Analytics Case

### Q: The data seems messy. Should I clean it?
**A:** Real-world data is messy! If you spot issues, note how you handled them in your analysis.

### Q: How detailed should my presentation be?
**A:** Think "executive presentation" not "technical deep-dive." You have 10 minutes - be concise and insightful. You can include technical details in backup slides or supporting files.

### Q: Should I include statistical tests?
**A:** Only if they add value and you can explain them clearly. Don't use statistics just to look sophisticated.

### Q: I found something unexpected in the data. Is this a bug?
**A:** Probably intentional! Unexpected findings are often the most interesting insights.

### Q: Can I make assumptions about missing information?
**A:** Yes, but document them clearly. For example, "I'm assuming delivery drivers are the same across all locations."

### Q: What format should my presentation be?
**A:** PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF - any format we can open and view is fine.

## Data Science Case

### Q: Should I rebuild the model from scratch?
**A:** Maybe! Or maybe the model is fine and the problem is elsewhere. Diagnose first, then decide on your approach.

### Q: What programming language should I use?
**A:** Python and R are most common, but use what you know. Make sure we can review your code.

### Q: The model documentation mentions XGBoost. Do I need to use that?
**A:** No! The existing model used XGBoost. Your solution can use whatever approach you think is best.

### Q: How should I validate my approach?
**A:** However you think is appropriate! Just explain your validation strategy clearly.

### Q: Should I tune hyperparameters extensively?
**A:** Focus on the core problem first. Fancy hyperparameter tuning won't impress us if you missed the main issue.

### Q: My code is messy. Is that okay?
**A:** Clean, commented code is preferred, but we understand time constraints. At minimum: it should run, be readable, and you should be able to explain it.

### Q: Can I use external libraries?
**A:** Yes, standard data science libraries are fine (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.). Just make sure we can reproduce your work - include a requirements.txt or equivalent.

## Submission & Logistics

### Q: What if I can't finish in 7 days?
**A:** Reach out BEFORE the deadline if you have a legitimate reason (illness, emergency, etc.). We're understanding but appreciate communication.

### Q: How should I submit my work?
**A:** [Follow the submission instructions provided separately - typically email or form upload]

### Q: What if my file sizes are too large?
**A:** Use Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar and share a link. Don't email 50MB files!

### Q: Should I include my raw working files?
**A:** Yes! Include any Excel files, Jupyter notebooks, R scripts, etc. We want to see your thought process.

### Q: Can I submit a video instead of a written presentation?
**A:** For Data Analytics, a video walkthrough is acceptable. For Data Science, we need written analysis + code.

## Evaluation

### Q: What are you looking for?
**A:** Clear thinking, good judgment, appropriate technical skills, and strong communication. We want to see your analytical process.

### Q: Will I get feedback?
**A:** Yes, all candidates receive feedback regardless of outcome.

### Q: If I don't pass, can I reapply?
**A:** Yes, after 6 months. Use the feedback to improve!

### Q: How long until I hear back?
**A:** Typically 1-2 weeks after submission. We'll let you know if there are delays.

### Q: Can I talk to past candidates?
**A:** We can connect you with program alumni who've agreed to help. Ask your recruiter.

## Technical Issues

### Q: The CSV file won't open properly in Excel
**A:** Try using Google Sheets or a text editor. If truly corrupted, contact us immediately.

### Q: I'm getting encoding errors with the data
**A:** Try UTF-8 encoding. If problems persist, reach out.

### Q: My visualization tool can't handle this much data
**A:** Consider aggregating or sampling. 21,000 rows shouldn't be a problem for modern tools though!
